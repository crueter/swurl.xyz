                <h1>Contact</h1>
		<ul>
            <li><a href="mailto:swurl@swurl.xyz">swurl@swurl.xyz</a></li>
			<li>XMPP: <code><a href="xmpp:swurl@swurl.xyz">swurl@swurl.xyz</a></code></li>
			<li><a href="swurl.gpg">Public GPG Key</a> (or run: <code>curl -L https://swurl.xyz/swurl.gpg | gpg --import</code>)</li>
			<ul>
                <li>Fingerprint: <code>5471 0C45 DB87 CA91 44E9  6EBF 4650 7311 CD29 2A08</code></li>
			</ul>
			<li>Alternatively, for XMPP, you may use OMEMO. My fingerprint is <code>1e1836f1-5022f012-7e78d738-95f3eadb-cfdb86a5-2cb34bd1-9f61ab16-68457555</code>.</li>
			<li>Matrix: <code>@swurl:swirl.funny.cl</code></li>
		</ul>
		<p>I am <b>not</b> on any other major social media platforms.</p>
		<h2>Rules</h2>
        <p>Email and XMPP communication <b>should</b> be encrypted. I'll let emails slide usually (esp. if there's no easy way to get your public key), but XMPP should be encrypted under all circumstances.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If you're too computer-incompetent or lazy to do this, just contact me via Matrix. Make sure the direct message room has encryption.</li>
		</ul>
        <p>All legitimate communication from me will be <b>signed</b> with my PGP key. It may be signed with another of my keys; this is from my laptop that I use for school. Either way, it should be signed under the name of swurl, email <b>roachh@protonmail.com</b> or <b>swurl@swurl.xyz</b>. If it's not signed, it's not legitimate. Period.</p>
        <p>Do not contact me if:</p>
        <ul>
			<li>You are selling something or want me to shill something -- unless it's something I use</li>
            <li>It's something about drama or soylebrities, esp. if it's about me</li>
            <li>You are a journalist</li>
            <li>You don't know anything about me or what I do</li>
			<li>Your sole purpose for contacting me is just to yell at me for using different software than you or calling me fatphobic or something. If you want to do that, do it through Matrix.</li>
            <li>You are trying to involve me in some sort of drama, blame me for something I did not do, or to simply get mad at me and yell at me for "harassing" you on Discord. Yes, this seriously happened. Even though it is <b>very clear</b> that I do NOT use Discord.</li>
        </ul>
